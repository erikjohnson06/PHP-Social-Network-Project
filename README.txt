social_network

Social network is an example of how a typical social networking site, such as Facebook or Twitter, might function. Users are allowed to join, search for other members, invite non-members to join the site, add network connections, create and join groups, make wall posts on their friend's profiles, comment on wall posts, and view their newsfeed. This project was completed as a part of O'Reilly's PHP/SQL 2 course in order to demonstrate the concept the relational database design.
