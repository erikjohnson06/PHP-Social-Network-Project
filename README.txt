social_network
==============

Social network is an example of how a typical social networking site might function. Users are allowed to join, search for other members, invite other members, add friends, create and join groups, make wall posts on their friend's profiles, comment on wall posts, and view their newsfeed. This project was completed as a part of O'Reilly's PHP/SQL 2 course.
